Allows image capabilities. 
Images on clipboard are sent to the llm, works best with images with text, but even images with no text can be described by the model.
Only tested with Gemini

If the image as text, it is possible to ask the llm to summarize, or key points, etc 

Added the ability to share an url direcly to the app. Copy the URL to the clipboard, if the app detects an URL on the clipboards, it will extract the text of that URL and make that content available for the usual app option, summarize, key points, etc.
