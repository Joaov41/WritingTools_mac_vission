Allows image capabilities. 
Images on clipboard are sent to the llm, works best with images with text, but even images with no text can be described by the model.
Only tested with Gemini

Added the ability to share an url direcly to the app. Copy the URL to the clipboard, if the app detects an URL on the clipboards, it will extract the text of that URL and make that content available for the usual app option, summarize, key points, etc.

Added the ability to feed a pdf file to the llm by using the context menu and copying to clipboard. The app will extract the text and send to LLm for the usual options.

07/02/2025 
Added the ability to feed a video file ( mp4)  to the llm by using the context menu and copying to clipboard. The video will be sent to the LLm for the usual options.

Testing how the code behaves with the latest Gemini models.
